# 🩺 Analyzing Diabetes Risk Factors in Public Health Data Using SQL

This project simulates a public health report using SQL queries on a real-world diabetes dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset).

## 🔍 Objective
To extract meaningful health insights from population-level diabetes data using SQL. This helps understand the impact of age, gender, BMI, smoking history, hypertension, and heart disease on diabetes prevalence.

## 🧰 Tools
- MySQL
- Dataset: `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Diabetes rate by age group and gender
- Impact of smoking history on diabetes
- Average HbA1c and BMI by diabetes status
- Diabetes prevalence in individuals with heart disease and hypertension

## 💡 Health Insights
- Higher diabetes rates observed among **males**
- **Higher BMI and HbA1c** levels are linked to diabetes.
- **Smokers and older adults** show significantly higher diabetes rates.
- Individuals with **heart disease or hypertension** are more likely to have diabetes.

## 📂 Files
- `diabetes_analysis.sql`: SQL queries used
- `dataset/`: Contains the CSV file used in the analysis
